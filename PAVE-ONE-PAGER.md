## Pave — Own a RoboTaxi. We run it. You earn.

### One‑liner
Finance or own an autonomous vehicle and deploy it as a robo‑taxi with guaranteed utilization in eligible cities. We handle compliance, deployment, operations, insurance, and earnings optimization. You receive monthly payouts and full transparency.

### Elevator Pitch
Autonomous ridehail is moving from pilots to production in select markets. Individuals will soon be able to own autonomous vehicles and earn income by deploying them as robo‑taxis. Pave provides a turnkey path to ownership with managed operations and a city‑specific utilization guarantee, de‑risking the opportunity and making it accessible to non‑technical owners and capital partners.

### Who It’s For
- **Operators/Owners**: Individuals or small entities who want passive income from autonomous vehicles without running day‑to‑day operations.
- **Capital Partners**: Investors seeking yield exposure to autonomous mobility assets through structured vehicles or revenue‑share financing.
- **Ecosystem Partners**: Ridehail networks, autonomy stack providers, charging and service depots, insurers, and municipalities seeking reliable, compliant supply.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Turnkey ownership**: We source, finance, deploy, insure, and operate vehicles; owners track performance and receive payouts.
- **Guaranteed utilization (city‑specific)**: Minimum revenue backstop for eligible cities and terms to build trust and reduce perceived risk.
- **Operations excellence**: Uptime, cleaning/charging SLAs, incident response, remote monitoring, and proactive maintenance.
- **Earnings optimization**: Demand heatmaps, dynamic scheduling, and network integrations to maximize net yield per vehicle.
- **Transparency and control**: Live dashboard, forecasts, and clear terms; owners can exit per program rules.

### The Problem
- High capex, regulatory uncertainty, and complex operations block would‑be owners from participating in autonomous mobility.
- Fragmented partners (OEMs, autonomy providers, ridehail networks, insurance, service depots) create integration and accountability gaps.
- Prospective owners lack reliable underwriting and utilization forecasts to justify acquisition and financing decisions.
